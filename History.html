      <h1>The era of factory Italian and Mercedes front-engine cars 1950–1957</h1>
      <p>
        Alfa Romeo dominated all before them in the 1950 season, winning every race bar one in the
        championship with the pre-war "Alfetta" 158s. Nino Farina won the inaugural championship,
        Juan Manuel Fangio taking it in 1951 with the Alfa-Romeo 159, an evolution of the 158.
        The Alfetta's engines were extremely powerful for their capacity: In 1951 the 159 engine was
        producing around 310 kW but this was at the price of a fuel consumption of 125 to 175 litres
        per 100 km. Enzo Ferrari, who had raced the Alfettas before the war, and his engine designer
        Aurelio Lampredi, were the first to understand that the 1.5-litre supercharged engine
        was a dead end: Any increase in power meant more fuel to carry or more time lost in the pits
        for refuelling. For the last races of 1950 Ferrari sent his 1.5-litre supercharged 125s to the
        museum, and fielded the new V12 4.5-litre normally aspirated 375s. With a fuel consumption of
        around 35 litres per 100 kilometres the 375s offered fierce opposition to the Alfettas towards
        the end of the 1951 season. Alfa Romeo, a state-owned company, decided to withdraw after a refusal
        of the Italian government to fund the expensive design of a new car. Surprisingly, Alfa Romeo
        involvement in racing was made with a very thin budget, using mostly pre-war technology and
        material during the two seasons. For instance the team won two championships using only nine
        pre-war built engine blocks.

      <h1>The DFV engine, 12-cylinder engines and the arrival of sponsorship, safety and aerodynamics 1968–1976</h1>
      <p>
        Ferrari won the Constructors titles in 1975, 1976, and 1977. Lauda took a relatively
        straightforward first Drivers' title in 1975. The main surprise of the season came when the tiny
        Hesketh team won the Dutch Grand Prix with James Hunt. Despite entering only one car and refusing
        sponsorship the team finished 4th in the Constructors' Championship. That year also saw Lella Lombardi score the first
        points by a woman in Formula One for 6th place at the Spanish Grand Prix.
        <br></br>
        For 1976, Fittipaldi made the surprising decision to drive for the Brazilian Fittipaldi Automotive
        team of his brother Wilson, sponsored by Copersucar. James Hunt, who knew that Hesketh's future was
        doomed by its lack of sponsorship (Lord Hesketh had tried to obtain major backing once he realised
        Hunt was a likely title contender and that he could no longer afford to run the team out of his own
        pocket), signed for McLaren. In 1976 Lauda's second successive title seemed inevitable until he
        crashed on the second lap at the Nürburgring, suffering severe burns as well as lung and blood
        damage. He was given the last rites but unbelievably was back in his Ferrari six weeks later.
        He lost the championship by a single point to James Hunt in heavy rain at the final round at Fuji
        in Japan when he pitted his car and refused to continue, declaring that the risk was too great and
        that from now on he would refuse to race under extreme conditions.
        <br></br>
        The incident at Fuji damaged Lauda's relationship with Enzo Ferrari and Lauda officially became
        the second driver of the Scuderia with Carlos Reutemann as leader. Lauda signed for Brabham before
        the end of the 1977 championship, having taken the title easily before Enzo Ferrari refused him a
        car for the end of the season. His second title was mostly built on regularity and reliability.
        Despite his conflict with the "Commendatore" and his second driver status Lauda enjoyed immense
        respect from the Ferrari team, which did its best to give him a good car. There was in fact a very
        competitive field that year but no single challenger to the Austrian emerged and points taken away
        from Ferrari were shared between many teams and drivers. Surprisingly, the new Wolf team, born from
        the ashes of Frank Williams Racing Cars and Hesketh, made excellent use of its legacy with
        Jody Scheckter finishing second to Niki Lauda.

      <h1>1988</h1>
      <p>
        The McLaren MP4/4 (as seen in the picture above) was a highly successful Formula 1 car that competed in the 1988 Formula
        One season. It was designed by engineer Steve Nichols, with assistance from the team's Technical
        Director Gordon Murray. Nichols and Murray based the design on the lowline Brabham BT55, designed
        by Murray for the 1986 season when Murray was chief designer at Brabham.
        <br></br>
        The Honda powered MP4/4 is one of the most dominant Formula One cars ever built, winning all
        but one race and claiming all but one pole position in the 1988 season. Statistically the car
        holds the record as the most dominant single season car with a winning percentage of 93.8% with
        the closest any car has come was in 2016 when the Mercedes F1 W07 Hybrid won 19 of 21 races (90.5%).
        <br></br>
        Safety issues finally helped resolve the dispute, after nearly 50 years, the power achieved by
        the turbocharged cars could finally match the 477 kW produced by the supercharged 1937
        Mercedes-Benz W125, without a huge consumption of special fuel. By 1986, some engines were
        producing over 970 kW in short bursts in qualifying. BMW's 750 kW dynamometer was incapable of
        measuring the output of their qualifying engines - Paul Rosche estimated that it might be as much
        as 1,000 kW.
        <br>First fuel consumption and then turbocharger boost were restricted to 4-bar in 1987 and
        1.5-bar in 1988. By 1988, the turbos were only slightly more powerful than the lighter 3.5-litre
        naturally aspirated cars that had been introduced the previous year. The thirsty turbo engines
        briefly saw refuelling introduced into the sport, but this was banned for 1984.</br>
        The Williams FW11 won the Constructors' Championship in 1986, the only year before 2014 in which
        every car in the field had a turbocharged engine With controversy at last left behind, the
        Formula One teams flourished through the remainder of the 1980s and into the 1990s. Despite the
        overwhelming dominance of two teams—McLaren and Williams—this period is regarded as one of
        the brightest spots in F1's 50-year history.

      <h1>3-litre engines 1995–1999</h1>
      <p>
        However, by 1995 things had settled down somewhat. The downgraded 3-litre formula had no effect
        of the domination of the Renault V10, and Schumacher took his second Drivers' title, and Benetton
        their first Constructors' title, with relative ease, defeating the Williams team of Hill and
        David Coulthard. The Renault engine which powered both teams was virtually unbeatable, with only
        Ferrari claiming a single win at the Canadian Grand Prix for Alesi, his only career win.
        <br></br>
        For 1996, the FIA mandated a much larger minimum size cockpit area, along with driver's head
        protection, to ensure the driver's head was less exposed. As part of his plan to rebuild Ferrari,
        Jean Todt brought Michael Schumacher to the team from Benetton that year, essentially in exchange
        for his 1995 drivers Alesi and Berger. There was an immediate effect, in his first year with the
        Scuderia Schumacher won three races, more than the team had managed in the previous five years.
        Ferrari were not championship contenders though and Damon Hill made a strong run to the title,
        finally claiming the crown after 3 years of almost but not quite.
        <br></br>
        In 1997, another son of an F1 racing legend took the titles for Williams once again, as Jacques
        Villeneuve became the 4th driver to take both the Formula One and CART championship
        (the others being Mario Andretti, Emerson Fittipaldi, and Nigel Mansell). This season was much
        closer than 1996, and Villeneuve only clinched the Drivers' Championship at the final race.
        Once again, Michael Schumacher collided with his championship rival at the final race, but
        unlike 1994 events turned against him. Schumacher not only found himself knocked out of the race,
        but was found to have deliberately tried to run Villeneuve off of the road. Schumacher was stripped
        of second place in the Championship and was disgraced.
        <br></br>
        At the end of 1997 Renault withdrew from Formula One. McLaren-Mercedes took the Drivers' Crown
        for the next two years, both being claimed by Mika Häkkinen. The Finn was nearly untouchable as
        he took his first title while Schumacher and Villeneuve could only watch. 1999 provided a stiffer
        contest for the title. Villeneuve was out of the picture at the brand-new BAR but Schumacher was
        in contention when he crashed and broke his leg at Silverstone. His teammate Eddie Irvine
        eventually lost by only two points to Mika Häkkinen, but his efforts contributed to Ferrari's first
        Constructors' Championship since 1983.

      <h1>V10 engine and road car manufacturer team era 2000–2004</h1>
      <p>
        After the banning of turbocharged engines in 1989, V10 became the most popular engine
        configuration in Formula One, because it offered the best compromise between power and fuel
        consumption. From the 1998 season onwards, all competing teams had V10 engines in their cars.
        V12s were powerful but thirsty, and vice versa for V8s. 2000 saw the grids of Formula One start
        to revert to normal, as Jordan rapidly faded out of sight, and Williams, looking forward to a new
        partnership with BMW started to reassert itself. The fight at the front, however, was very much
        between Häkkinen and Schumacher, each two-time champion, driving cars closely matched in
        performance. Ferrari had been steadily improving since their low point in the early 1990s and in
        2000 Schumacher prevailed, becoming the first 3 time Champion since Senna, and bringing the World
        Drivers' title to Ferrari for the first time since Jody Scheckter in 1979.
        <br></br>
        In 2004 Ferrari and Schumacher returned to almost total dominance of the championships,
        winning both with ease (in the car you see above) in the first thirteen races of the season,
        Schumacher managed to win twelve. A new race in Bahrain made its debut in April and another new
        race in China debuted in September. It was initially thought that in introducing these new races,
        older Grands Prix in Europe, like the British Grand Prix, might be removed from the championship,
        but instead the number of races was increased to eighteen. According to Ecclestone, the move was
        to increase Formula One's global reach, though the steady tightening of restrictions on tobacco
        advertising in Europe and elsewhere may also have been a factor. This move saw the percentage of
        races held outside Formula One's traditional European home climb to around fifty percent – meaning
        the World Championship, which visits four of the six continents, truly deserves its name. 2004
        was Michael Schumacher's most recent of his record seven World Championships. Schumacher also holds
        the record for the most races won – with ninety-one.

      <h1>Cost cutting measures and departure of factory teams 2009–2013</h1>
      <p>
        Throughout the 2000s, Formula One cars had become extremely complex, efficient and reliable,
        so much so that actual racing between drivers began to become less and less common. 2009 saw the
        introduction of many new rules and regulations, including engine rev limits, an adjustable front
        wing and disproportionate wing sizes, to encourage overtaking. Engines were revving up to 20,000 rpm
        and were initially limited to 19,000 rpm for 2009, but then this was lowered to 18,000 from 2010 to
        2013.
        <br>2010 saw more changes in the way of rules and regulations. KERS and double diffusers were
        banned for the 2010 season, but new innovative features on the cars such as F-Ducts were
        introduced. An allocated eight engines, per driver, for the whole season was also introduced as
        part of more cost cutting methods. The biggest change in the points scoring system in F1 history
        happened between 2009 & 2010. The 10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1 point system for the top eight finishers
        ,which had been running since 2003, was replaced with the drastically different
        25-18-15-12-10-8-6-4-2-1 for the top 10 finishers.</br>
        <br></br>
        Red Bull Racing returned to have a great season in 2010, thanks to their hiring of designer Adrian
        Newey in 2007. They won the Constructors' Championship in the penultimate round in Brazil, and
        Red Bull driver Sebastian Vettel won the championship in the final round of the 2010 season at
        Abu Dhabi. Mercedes GP had a much less successful and winless season than
        2009 with their two new drivers – seven-time World Champion Michael Schumacher who returned to
        Formula One, but was regularly beaten by fellow German, Nico Rosberg. McLaren and Ferrari had
        better seasons in 2010, finishing second and third in the constructors, respectively. The Drivers'
        Championship was very closely fought, with six men leading the championship at one point, in the
        joint longest ever (nineteen-race) season. For most of the season, the title looked like it could
        have gone to either Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel or Mark Webber, or either McLaren's Lewis Hamilton
        or reigning World Champion Jenson Button. But, the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso
        clawed back 47-points after the British Grand Prix, to be leading the Drivers' Championship with
        two races left. A record four drivers were still in contention for the title going into the final
        round in Abu Dhabi. They were Alonso, Webber, Vettel and Hamilton ,placing in that order in number
        of points before the race. They did not finish that way though, with Vettel winning the race and
        the title when the others finished too far down the field. Vettel became the youngest ever World
        Champion in the history of the sport.

      <h1>1.6-litre turbocharged V6 hybrid engines 2014–present</h1>
      <p>
        Formula One entered its second turbocharged era in 2014. Australia was the location of the end of
        the first era (Adelaide 1988) and start of the second (Melbourne 2014). The series is being run
        under the most radical engine regulation changes since 1995. All cars entering any Formula One
        championship race must run with 1.6-litre single turbocharged 6-cylinder engines with a rev limit
        of 15,000 rpm and maximum fuel flow of 100 kg/hr. New car regulations will also be enforced, and
        the minimum weight regulations will be raised from 642 kg to 690 kg. Ferrari,
        Mercedes and Renault will be producing engines for this new formula, Cosworth did not participate
        from 2014 and beyond. Honda returned to supplying McLaren with engines in 2015. In-season engine
        development will return, the previous V8's development was frozen. The new turbo engines are
        reckoned to produce 447 kW (the previous V8s produce approximately 750 hp), but the new Energy
        Recovery System (ERS) will be twice as powerful as the current KERS system, this new ERS system
        will give the drivers up to the equivalent of 160 hp when activated, the current KERS gives cars an
        extra 80 hp when activated.
        <br></br>
        Since the 2014 season, the Mercedes team and their drivers Lewis Hamilton, Nico Rosberg and
        Valtteri Bottas have dominated the sport, winning all but 16 races (40 for Hamilton, 20 for
        Rosberg and 3 for Bottas). This astounding and historic winning streak has been the result of
        Mercedes development of the "split turbocharger", a system in which the compressor and turbine
        components of the turbo charger are placed at separate sides of the engine and connected by a rod
        running through the V of the engine. This new technology gave Mercedes and their customer teams
        many advantages over their competitors due to the need for less cooling and a more compact power
        unit. The only other drivers to win races during this period are Daniel Ricciardo and
        Max Verstappen of Red Bull, along with Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari.
