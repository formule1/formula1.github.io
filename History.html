      <h1>The era of factory Italian and Mercedes front-engine cars 1950–1957</h1>
      <p>
        Alfa Romeo dominated all before them in the 1950 season, winning every race bar one in the
        championship with the pre-war "Alfetta" 158s. Nino Farina won the inaugural championship,
        Juan Manuel Fangio taking it in 1951 with the Alfa-Romeo 159, an evolution of the 158.
        The Alfetta's engines were extremely powerful for their capacity: In 1951 the 159 engine was
        producing around 310 kW but this was at the price of a fuel consumption of 125 to 175 litres
        per 100 km. Enzo Ferrari, who had raced the Alfettas before the war, and his engine designer
        Aurelio Lampredi, were the first to understand that the 1.5-litre supercharged engine
        was a dead end: Any increase in power meant more fuel to carry or more time lost in the pits
        for refuelling. For the last races of 1950 Ferrari sent his 1.5-litre supercharged 125s to the
        museum, and fielded the new V12 4.5-litre normally aspirated 375s. With a fuel consumption of
        around 35 litres per 100 kilometres the 375s offered fierce opposition to the Alfettas towards
        the end of the 1951 season. Alfa Romeo, a state-owned company, decided to withdraw after a refusal
        of the Italian government to fund the expensive design of a new car. Surprisingly, Alfa Romeo
        involvement in racing was made with a very thin budget, using mostly pre-war technology and
        material during the two seasons. For instance the team won two championships using only nine
        pre-war built engine blocks.

      <h1>The DFV engine, 12-cylinder engines and the arrival of sponsorship, safety and aerodynamics 1968–1976</h1>
      <p>
        Ferrari won the Constructors titles in 1975, 1976, and 1977. Lauda took a relatively
        straightforward first Drivers' title in 1975. The main surprise of the season came when the tiny
        Hesketh team won the Dutch Grand Prix with James Hunt. Despite entering only one car and refusing
        sponsorship the team finished 4th in the Constructors' Championship. That year also saw Lella Lombardi score the first
        points by a woman in Formula One for 6th place at the Spanish Grand Prix.
        <br></br>
        For 1976, Fittipaldi made the surprising decision to drive for the Brazilian Fittipaldi Automotive
        team of his brother Wilson, sponsored by Copersucar. James Hunt, who knew that Hesketh's future was
        doomed by its lack of sponsorship (Lord Hesketh had tried to obtain major backing once he realised
        Hunt was a likely title contender and that he could no longer afford to run the team out of his own
        pocket), signed for McLaren. In 1976 Lauda's second successive title seemed inevitable until he
        crashed on the second lap at the Nürburgring, suffering severe burns as well as lung and blood
        damage. He was given the last rites but unbelievably was back in his Ferrari six weeks later.
        He lost the championship by a single point to James Hunt in heavy rain at the final round at Fuji
        in Japan when he pitted his car and refused to continue, declaring that the risk was too great and
        that from now on he would refuse to race under extreme conditions.
        <br></br>
        The incident at Fuji damaged Lauda's relationship with Enzo Ferrari and Lauda officially became
        the second driver of the Scuderia with Carlos Reutemann as leader. Lauda signed for Brabham before
        the end of the 1977 championship, having taken the title easily before Enzo Ferrari refused him a
        car for the end of the season. His second title was mostly built on regularity and reliability.
        Despite his conflict with the "Commendatore" and his second driver status Lauda enjoyed immense
        respect from the Ferrari team, which did its best to give him a good car. There was in fact a very
        competitive field that year but no single challenger to the Austrian emerged and points taken away
        from Ferrari were shared between many teams and drivers. Surprisingly, the new Wolf team, born from
        the ashes of Frank Williams Racing Cars and Hesketh, made excellent use of its legacy with
        Jody Scheckter finishing second to Niki Lauda.

      <h1>1988</h1>
      <p>
        The McLaren MP4/4 (as seen in the picture above) was a highly successful Formula 1 car that competed in the 1988 Formula
        One season. It was designed by engineer Steve Nichols, with assistance from the team's Technical
        Director Gordon Murray. Nichols and Murray based the design on the lowline Brabham BT55, designed
        by Murray for the 1986 season when Murray was chief designer at Brabham.
        <br></br>
        The Honda powered MP4/4 is one of the most dominant Formula One cars ever built, winning all
        but one race and claiming all but one pole position in the 1988 season. Statistically the car
        holds the record as the most dominant single season car with a winning percentage of 93.8% with
        the closest any car has come was in 2016 when the Mercedes F1 W07 Hybrid won 19 of 21 races (90.5%).
        <br></br>
        Safety issues finally helped resolve the dispute; after nearly 50 years, the power achieved by
        the turbocharged cars could finally match the 477 kW produced by the supercharged 1937
        Mercedes-Benz W125, without a huge consumption of special fuel. By 1986, some engines were
        producing over 970 kW in short bursts in qualifying. BMW's 750 kW dynamometer was incapable of
        measuring the output of their qualifying engines - Paul Rosche estimated that it might be as much
        as 1,000 kW.
        <br>First fuel consumption and then turbocharger boost were restricted to 4-bar in 1987 and
        1.5-bar in 1988. By 1988, the turbos were only slightly more powerful than the lighter 3.5-litre
        naturally aspirated cars that had been introduced the previous year. The thirsty turbo engines
        briefly saw refuelling introduced into the sport, but this was banned for 1984.</br>
        The Williams FW11 won the Constructors' Championship in 1986, the only year before 2014 in which
        every car in the field had a turbocharged engine With controversy at last left behind, the
        Formula One teams flourished through the remainder of the 1980s and into the 1990s. Despite the
        overwhelming dominance of two teams—McLaren and Williams—this period is regarded as one of
        the brightest spots in F1's 50-year history.
